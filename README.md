# The-Cheezer-CI

Cinematic Intro for The Cheezer CMPM 120 Demo Project

## Satisfied Requirements

* 3+ scenes (not counting intro/outro slides or others used only for fading effects)\
  * Begin Scene
  * Studio Intro Scene
  * Cinematic Menu Scene
  * Gameplay Scene
* 2+ audio assets (such as .wav files)\
For all these audio assets, I used audacity and recorded real life sound effects of the objects I wanted to represent.
  * CheeseFall.wav
  * CheeseSlap.wav
  * FridgeClose.wav
  * FridgeOpen.wav
* 2+ image assets (such as .png files)\
For all these image assets, I used illustrator and live painted pixel art except for the fridges.\
For the fridges, I took it from https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/5146413-refrigerator-pixel-art and changed it from white to green in illustrator (same live paint technique) and modified it further for the half opened and opened images.
